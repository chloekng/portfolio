			<br>
			<div class="bodytext">
				<p>From August 2016 to Spring 2017, I conducted design research on the <a href="http://best.berkeley.edu/best-research/samsung-next-digital-and-the-internet-of-things/">Samsung Beyond Smartphones</a> team, helping envision the future of AR/VR, wearables, medical devices, and iOT.</p>
				<br> 
				<p>We created a hardware and software solution that helps pregnant mothers and doctors monitor fetal heart rate. I primarily worked on the UX for the software app, analyzing needs for both pregnant parents and doctors and translating them to wireframes and user flows.</p>

					<p class="h2">Designing for Pregnancy</p>
					<p>Through ethnographic research and observational studies, we found that pregnancy was a time of anxiety for many parents. We quickly realized that we weren't just designing for parents, but also doctors. It was a challenge juggling different stakeholders in a specialized and high stakes context that we didn't have much prior knowledge in. However, we saw the potential to solve many pain points in this area. <span class="highlight">We read up on FDA regulations, talked to labor & delivery nurses, interviewed doctors at UCSF, and asked mothers what their needs were.</span></p>
