			<br>
			<div class="bodytext">
				<p>From August 2016 to Spring 2017, I conducted design research on the <a href="http://best.berkeley.edu/best-research/samsung-next-digital-and-the-internet-of-things/">Samsung Beyond Smartphones</a> team, helping envision the future of AR/VR, wearables, medical devices, and iOT.</p>
				<br> 
				<p>We created a hardware and software solution that helps pregnant mothers and doctors monitor fetal heart rate. I primarily worked on the UX for the software app, analyzing needs for both pregnant parents and doctors and translating them to wireframes and user flows.</p>

					<p class="h2">Designing for Pregnancy</p>
					<p>Through ethnographic research and observational studies, we found that pregnancy was a time of anxiety for many parents. It was a challenge juggling different stakeholders in a specialized and high stakes context that we didn't have much prior knowledge in. However, we saw the potential to solve many pain points in this area. <span class="highlight">We read up on FDA regulations, talked to labor & delivery nurses, interviewed doctors at UCSF, and asked mothers what their needs were.</span></p>

			<p class="h3" id="beyondsmartphoneProblem">Problem</p>
				<p>We approached solving these pain points in three main ways:</p>
				<ol>
					<br>
					<li>How might we provide parents peace of mind during pregnancy?</li>
					<br>
					<li>How might we help doctors collect relevant and accurate fetal heart rate data?</li>
					<br>
					<li>How might we facilitate better remote communication between parents and experts?</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
			<p class="h3" id="beyondsmartphoneIdeation">Ideation</p>
				<p>We generated over 450 concepts. Through needs analysis and concept clustering, we settled on the concept of <span class="highlight">Fitbit for Embryos</span>. The fitbit for embryos would involve a stretchable, wearable belt for pregnant mothers to wear. Electrodes in the belt provides detailed data on the baby to parents and doctors via a companion software app. Our team split in two to tackle both the hardware and software aspects.</p>

				<Br>
				<p>To get an idea of adjacent solutions, the software team first conducted an audit of 20 pregnancy apps. We found that many focused around helping parents keep track of kick counts, providing relevant pregnancy literature, and informing parents of their baby's development via fruit sizes. </p>

					<p>Our app solution involved <span class="highlight">three main components: real-time fetal monitoring data, memory keeping, and doctor communication.</span></p>
					<br>
					<p class="h2">Real-time Fetal Monitoring Data</p>
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/beyondsmartphones-data.png">
					<p class="minitext">Different ways we considered displaying data, from extremely detailed to very limited.</p>
					<Br>
					<p>One key design decision we kept returning to was what data to show parents. Parents were divided on the issue, with some wanting more data while others expressed concern about having too much information.</p>
					<div class="writeup-subsection">
						<p class="h3-2">I actually don't want to know that much information regarding my baby because it would stress me out. I want to go about my job without having my baby's status constantly on my mind.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="writeup-subsection">
						<p class="h3-2">I know some moms express concern about this but I would love if I could easily check my baby's heart rate. Not as a diagnostic if I think something is wrong, more just for the fun of it.</p>
						<p class="minitext">Willa, mother of 2</p>
					</div>
					<div class="writeup-subsection">
						<p class="h3-2">I would be concerned giving parents that sort of information. With ECG charts, data can be very complex and require professional interpretation. That sort of information would stress patients out unnecessarily.</p>

					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/beyondsmartphones-datascreens.png">
					<p class="minitext">The data display we ultimately settled on.</p>
					<br>
					<p>To address this conflict, we decided to provide parents limited data when it came to sensitive metrics like fetal heart rate, but detailed data when it came to metrics like the mother's heart rate, the baby's position, or kick counts. In this way, <span class="highlight">mothers can feel a sense of connection with their baby and 'check up on them' while not being overwhelmed by all the minutae of fetal heart rate monitoring.</span></p>

					<p class="minitext">Different ways we considered showing memory keeping for parents.</p>

					<p>While parents were hesitant regarding monitoring their baby's data in a diagnostic sense, they did want to document their pregnancies. </p>
