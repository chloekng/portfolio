					<div class="bigtext">Bringing parents and kids together on the task of brushing teeth.</div>
					<p>Twinkle is a dental hygiene solution for kids. It makes the mundane task of brushing teeth into a fun and desirable activity. Our team's goal was to craft a mobile application that brought parents and kids together on the task of brushing teeth.</p>
					<p> The application makes use of the front facing smartphone camera to track the sectors of the mouth that the child is brushing, providing parents detailed information on their kids brushing quality. Through fun camera-based games, Twinkle attempts to add excitement to the task of brushing so that kids have motivation to come back every day. </p>

				<div class="subheader" id="twinkle-research">User Research</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p>In six 20-minute in-person interviews, we uncovered key insights into the relationship between parents, kids, and brushing teeth. Finding users was a challenge, as our team didn't have any direct connections to the target audience of parents of young children. We got resourceful and visited a local library to approach any parents we found.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Parental Concerns</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Parents were chiefly concerned with getting their kids to brush without reminders or nagging and getting kids to brush all areas of the mouth for a satisfactory amount of time (typically 2 minutes).</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Kids Like Customizability</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Kids are excited about getting items in games, and particularly enjoy games where customizing appearance is a feature.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Kids Want to Feel Grown Up</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Kids enjoy feeling grown up through gaining more responsibilities. Many kids mentioned liking a sense of progression.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Parents on Their Kids & Tech</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Parents generally limit their kid's interaction with tech, seeking to limit 'smartphone dependency.'' A key concern is the fear that tech draws kids away from real life skills.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="writeup-section">
				<div class="subheader" id="twinkle-ideation">Ideation to Testing</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p>Our team diverged to create initial sketches for the app, then converged to discuss and create the mid-fidelity. With this method, we explored a range of possible ideas before committing to our first iteration. We then created a clickable prototype on POP.
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-figma.png">
					<p class="minitext">Our collaborative Figma of the low-fidelity. </p>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>We tested our clickable prototype with seven families through in-person usability tests at a local mall. While we initially had some difficulties finding people willing to talk, we ultimately found that talking to families at the rest area was effective. In general, these families were low-income, a part of  Twinkle's primary target audience. Through these tests, we uncovered some overarching issues.</p>

			<div class="writeup-section">
				<div class="subheader" id="twinkle-decisions">Key Design Decisions</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p class="bodytext-h">How do we integrate the parent and kid's sections?</p>
						<p>We decided on a home page where both are accessible. We decided to PIN lock the parent section so that kids can't access it.</p>
						<p>Our first iteration was confusing as the landing didn't communicate as a homepage.</p>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-sections.png">
						<p>We instead decided for a landing page that prompted users to swipe up or down to access each section. This helped give users context and a better understanding of the app's architecture.</p>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-newlanding.png">
						<p>A concern was whether or not swiping would be intuitive for kids.  Therefore, if the user taps on either arrow, they will also be transported to the respective area of the app.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How does a kid navigate while holding a toothbrush?</p>
						<p>In our user scenarios, we envisioned the parent handing off the app to the kid with the front facing camera activated. In this situation, it made sense for the kid to have control over what game to choose via the camera mode. </p>
						<p>This scenario provided particular gestural constraints. We wanted to make sure that the navigation was easy, as it would be completely through gesture and would lack certain functions of touch control, such as tapping.</p>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-gamegesture.png">
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How do you make sure the kid stays in front of the phone?</p>
						<p>As the app's tracking depends on kids staying within the frame of the camera, we also had to figure out how to communicate to energetic kids that they needed to stay within a range.</p>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-positioning.png">
						<ul>
							<li>The frame flashes red and makes warning sounds once a kid is outside the range</li>
							<br>
							<li>The screen also shows a green silhouette of a person in the center, to encourage the kid to return to the center of the screen</li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">What data do we include in the parent dashboard?</p>
						<p>In our interviews, we found that many parents 'settled' when it came to their kid's brushing. "I just make sure she brushed, hopefully for somewhere around two minutes. I don't have the energy to even make sure she's brushing the right areas."</p>
						<p> Based on this, our aim was to quickly provide parents with key data. However, we wanted to balance this out with more in-depth information as well, such that parents can get a better sense of their kid's brushing habits &mdash; a holistic view that is hard to track without an app.
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-parentdash.png"></p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How can we make the UI attractive to both kids and parents?</p>
						<p>For the kids section, we incorporated larger buttons illustrated by icons, for younger children who may not know how to read yet. We also avoided hiding elements &mdash;  for example, how a hamburger icon hides a menu as we wanted to make navigation as clear as possible. Though we used bright colors throughout the app, we kept the parents' section more muted in comparison to the kids' section. We also used metaphors such as "Treasure Chest" to inject some playfulness for the kids.
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-kidvparent.png">
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How do we reward kids?</p>
						<p>Parents were concerned about motivating their kids via digital rewards, as they felt the focus wasn't on forming good habits. In order to enhance parent-kid relationships, and not replace them with the app, we decided to implement a reward system that required the parent to reward the kid. By having the parent in control of the rewards, we also promoted opportunities for parents to discuss why having good brushing habits were essential.</p>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-rewardsystem.png">
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How can we onboard adding kid profiles?</p>
						<p>Making an overall account and then an individual account for the kid was confusing for people. Its initial placement on the landing made it unclear that the profile was also an element of the parent dashboard. Therefore, we changed decided to make it a part of the initial onboarding process.
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-onboardingkid.png">
						The initial language on the left was confusing. People weren't sure what the benefits for adding a kid's profile was, or how that related to the rest of the app.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How can we make instructions attractive to kids?</p>
						<p>The series of instructions that came prior to brushing  wasn't engaging. We therefore decided to include an animal mascot that 	interacted with kids. This also helped us tie the brand closely with the app.
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/twinkle-mascot.png"></p>

					<p>Twinkle appeals to  the target audience of 5-12 year olds through colorful and bold design elements that are playful and exciting. We chose a bunny as the logo as it's a friendly animal that is known for its teeth. An animal logo also provides an engaging mascot that kids of all appearance can relate to.</p>

				<div class="subheader" id="twinkle-reflection">Reflection</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p>One key takeaway from this project was rethinking our app's relationship with people. Working in tech, it's easy to think that tech is the solution to everything. However in our user research, we realized that tech dependency is a concern for many people. While we were stuck at this point, our mentor Adam Mansour pointed out how we could address parental concerns by having the tech not replace parent-kid interactions, but instead supplement and encourage them. By getting to the core of people's worry about tech &mdash; replacement of real relationships &mdash; we were able to design a solution that accounted for people's fears.</p>
