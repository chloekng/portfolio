					<p>We interviewed twenty five people on their air travel experience. Here are our insights.</p> 
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>People forget or don't have time to prepare everything they optimally would have for traveling (28.8% of people forget to charge devices)</li>
						<br>
						<li>It's tough to find what you want and where to go in airports, with so much signage (much of which isn't directly relevant)</li>
						<br>
						<li>There is a lot of time based stress, especially in regards to things outside of a traveler's control, such as the security line</li>
						<br>
						<li>Food is expensive; people don't expect a good food experience</li>
						<br>
						<li>Nobody likes anything about security screening</li>
						<br>
						<li>A million ways to be bored</li>

				<div class="bodytext">
					<p>From this research, we came up with a first iteration of our app. This first iteration focused on planning, guiding users through preparing for air travel all the way through to the airport gate. However, early feedback was not positive and the app felt "heavy-handed." We learned an important lesson from this first iteration. </p>
					<p class="bigtext">Let users come to the app.</p>
					<p>Instead of telling people what to do and forcing attention, we should be providing information relevant to their context. For our next iteration, we decided to narrow our focus to the specific problem of boredom on airports. </p> 
					<p>Therefore, we came up with the concept of Wing It.</p>

			<div class="writeup-section" id="wingit-iterations">
				<div class="subheader">Iterations</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p>Now with a clearer idea of our app in mind, we dove into iterating and user testing. In this process, we used methods such as  RITE testing,  think-aloud user testing, and retrospective recall. We also referred back to heuristics. Below are some of the decisions we made.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Quests Landing</p>
					<p>For the Quests Landing page, we needed to display quests and quest categories in a way that would be easily scannable. We wanted to make sure users could easily compare relevant information between quests when choosing a quest. </p>
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/wingit-questlanding.png">
					<ul> 
						<li><p class="bodytext-h">Variation 1</p>Our initial categorizations were pretty rudimentary. We knew that location would be particularly important for travelers weighed down by luggage, so a majority of the screen is taken up by a map</li>
						<br>
						<li><p class="bodytext-h">Variation 2</p>We tried a different method of displaying the categories, where users can see a preview quest of each category. Our hope was that would give users a general idea of the possibilities out there. We also began fleshing out nuanced quest categories</li>
						<br>
						<li><p class="bodytext-h">Variation 3</p>After AB testing, we found that users were generally open to clicking on different tabs to check out different categories. To preserve the highlighting feature that Variation 2 allowed for, we included "Featured" as a category. The top bar layout also made navigation into quest category names organic. We continued testing quest category names, and considered including images to feature quests</li>
						<br>
						<li><p class="bodytext-h">Variation 4</p>Taking a page from Google Maps, the Quests panel as a whole can be dragged up or down, such that the user has control over how central the map is on the screen. This is particularly relevant for categories such as "Simple," that don't require a user to leave their seat. To improve scanning on an already packed page, we decided against the images and instead opted for a cleaner UI where the rewards and time estimate would stand out (important decision factors for users)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Quests Flow</p>
					<p>One initial consideration was for all the steps of a quest to be displayed on one scrolling page. While this laid out the future steps very clearly, it was also overwhelming for users and made the expected user interaction unclear. Therefore, we chose to split the various steps of a quest into separate pages. This also allowed us to include the map only where it made sense for the user to refer to it.</p>
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/wingit-questflow.png">
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">Rewards Section</p>
					<p>We played around with wording quite a bit in the Rewards section, as users in testing were rather confused regarding the different categories. Accounting for the limitations in our testing, we found that "Spend Gold" helped establish a stronger correlation between the gold that people earned in quests, and buying rewards through gold. We also found that users interpreted the greyed out reward &mdash; initially meant to show a reward that wasn't applicable in a current airport &mdash; in vastly different ways. We therefore went for a more clear defined layout categorization.</p>
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/wingit-rewards.png">
					<p class="bodytext-h">Contextual Solutions</p>
					<p>In our usability tests, we also discovered that users at the airport had a whole different set of needs than users normally might regarding a restaurant. Given that they are just passing through the airport, they are only interested in what's currently open. The location of the restaurant also plays a huge factor, as people are limited to a specific terminal.</p>
					<p>Due to this, people are not likely to become loyal customers of an airport eatery, so we decided to go for a rating system over a review system. While the rating system limits feedback to certain constraints, users in general will also be approaching these restaurants with a different mindset with the time constraints and stress of air travel. The rating system therefore provides a quick and dirty way of evaluating a restaurant that provides the necessary information fast, and also makes it simple for users to evaluate a restaurant.</p>
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/wingit-contextual.png">
					<p class="bodytext-h">Global Search</p>
					<p>Through talking to users, we realized that we were missing a key feature &mdash; a global search. By having a global search, we could also organically suggest people quests related to what they were searching, rather than requiring them to specifically look up quests. We realized that it didn't make much sense in the user journey for people to look up quests randomly while walking through the airport. However, users will naturally want to look up a coffee place. In the search, we can alert them of a coffee place with a Quest partnership with us, therefore directing the user to try out the restaurant.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>It's never too early to user test and get feedback</li>
						<br>
						<li>Consider the user's context when they use an app. They have specific needs and emotions in the moment that can affect their approach to your app</li>
						<br>
						<li>Meet the user where they are, rather than add more cognitive load</li>
						<br>
						<li>To conduct user research, just go out and approach people! People are more open than you think to having a quick chat</li> 
						<br>
						<li>If given more time, I would want to test the app in-situation, during a real-time airport journey</li>
						<br>
						<li>This app may still be too overwhelming for an already stressed out traveler. We should consider how we can strip down the level of detail on some of the pages to only display the most relevant information to a traveler</li>
