				<p class="h3" id="fdvrRole">Role</p>
				<p>In January 2017, I joined our three person design team full-time. I took lead on user research and usability tests, and designed several components for introducing new features on our mobile VR platform. I worked closely with Grant, our Design Manager, and Anna, a fellow product designer.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="h3" id="fdvrGoals">Goals</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Conduct a usability audit of our current Fulldive VR platform</li>
						<Br>
						<li>Design how we introduce new features in VR. Due to our limited resources, we had to keep our redesigns to specific areas of our platform rather than redesigning from scratch. </li>
						<br>

						<p>Over a week, I facilitated <span class="highlight">5 usability test sessions, each 90 minutes long.</span> Our usability testers included people who either had no experience in virtual reality, or had only tried it once or twice.</p>

				<p class="minitext">Our color coded feature completion spreadsheet for a session. We used this spreadsheet to compare how successful users were at various tasks. This helped us prioritize the features we needed to tackle.</p>

						<p>Overall, we surfaced 37 usability issues that we wanted to fix. These ranged from changes in language and interaction to fixing up flows.</p>

					<p class="h2">Establishing mobile VR design principles</p>
						<p>To ensure that we continued designing with users in mind, I also assembled a short list of insights for the design team to keep central when designing for mobile VR.</p>
						<ul>
							<br>
							<li>Consider neck movements in relation to eyeline when you design - it's easier for people to look side to side rather than up and down</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't overwhelm the user! It might be tempting to use all that space, but user's view ports are very narrow and they're in a new environment</li>
							<br>
							<li>Have a clearly defined hierarchy so users know where they are in the app</li>
							<br>
							<li>Consider distance when designing. Uncomfortably close UI is offputting. Changes in depth are an opportunity to draw attention to things</li>
							<br>
							<li>Clear tap targets prevent accidental misclicking, a prevalent problem with autoclicking</li>
							<br>
							<li>Smooth voice control is more important than ever in VR</li>
							<br>
							<li>No one likes to read, and they like to read even less in VR</li>
						</ul>
						<Br>
						<br>
					<p class="h3" id="fdvrProblem">Problem</p>
						<p class="h2">How can we introduce features to users in a non-obtrusive and informative manner?</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">People really don't like reading in mobile VR.</span> In many places throughout our app, we had overlaid tutorial cards to explain features to people. Only one out of our testers read anything on the cards.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The question then was how to introduce new features in a way that wasn't obtrusive, but still provided some context for users. </p>
						<br>
						<p class="h2">More specifically &mdash; how do we introduce the Feed?</p>
						<p>At the time, we were introducing a new section of our app &mdash; the Feed. Problems with the feed:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>People were confused by how the feed was different from the main homepage of the app</li>
							<br>
							<li>People could only provide superficial answers about different UI</li>
							<Br>
							<li>Without following people, the feed doesn't have much content</li>
						</ul>
						<Br>

					<p class="minitext">Our following feed prior to testing, designed by Grant Lin.</p>
					<br>
					<p><span class="highlight">The following feed was a key area for us to increase retention, as it was the primary area for personalized content. We therefore decided this was a key feature to make sure we were introducing right.</span> I broke the problem down into three main parts:</p>
						<ol>
						<br>
						<li>Introduce people to the idea that content on their feed was what people they were following were watching</li>
						<br>
						<li>Encourage people to follow others in order to populate their feed</li>
						<br>
						<li>Establish patterns for introducing features in mobile VR that don't involve modal overlays</li>
						</ol>
					<br>
					<p class="h3" id="fdvrIdeation">Ideation</p>
<!-- 						reference: https://trello.com/c/cX99CF0o/245-tutorial-card-tips-in-feed-vr-library -->
						<p>I started off by researching how other apps introduced features in mobile VR and evaluating their effectiveness. I liked how many apps drew from gaming conventions, such as by highlighting features, or providing interactive elements. I mocked up some potential directions, choosing to do so in high fidelity since experiencing UI live is so essential in mobile VR. Following are some of the more viable options.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="h2">Onboarding Setup</p>
							<video class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fd-feedrec.mp4" autoplay=true loop=true></video>
							<p class="minitext">Feed designed by Grant Lin, follow recommendations by me.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Providing following suggestions upfront. To make the suggestions more personal, I included a line that explained why someone might be recommended to them - for example, if they both watched a certain video.</p>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Pros:</li></span>
								<p>Contextual setup to the following feed, encourages people to follow others, action oriented</p>
								<br>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Cons:</li></span>
								<p>People may not want to follow others so fast without first previewing the following feed, this may also seem similar to a modal in the sense that it's blocking their access to content</p>
								<br>
							</ul>
						<p class="h2">In-feed content</p>
							<video class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fulldive-infeed.mp4" autoplay=true loop=true></video>
							<p class="minitext">Feed designed by Grant Lin, "Recommended for you to follow" section and interaction by me.</p>
							<br>
							<p>In-Feed tool tips occur within the feed itself. These tooltips should be related to the content of the feed itself, and push for greater engagement.</p>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Pros:</li></span>
								<p>Contextual so can easily show the benefit of a certain behavior, within the flow of content consumption so guaranteed to be seen and interacted with to a certain extent, space to elaborate on feature and push for an action</p>
								<br>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Cons:</li></span>
								<p>Can seem ad-like by breaking up the flow of content consumption, takes up space of content so should be used sparingly, may not be able to demonstrate action as well</p>
								<br>
							</ul>
						<p class="h2">Attention Dot & Pointers</p>
							<video class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/vr-attnpointer.mp4" autoplay=true loop=true></video>
							<p class="minitext">Profile designed by Grant Lin, attention dot & pointer interaction by me.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Attention dots draw people's attention to specific features. When hovered over, they expand to include more information.</p>
							<Br>
							<ul>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Pros:</li></span>
								<p>Lightweight way of directing attention, low cognitive load that only expands when a user opts into interacting with it, exists within the context of the feature</p>
								<br>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Cons:</li></span>
								<p>Can be obtrusive or annoying if there are too many, limited to a small area, purely verbal which may have limited impact on a user</p>
								<br>
							</ul>
							<br>
						<p class="h2">Mini tutorials</p>
							<video class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fulldive-minitut.mp4" autoplay=true loop=true></video>
							<p class="minitext">Home & Profile designed by Grant Lin, overlaid tutorial designed by me.</p>
							<Br>
							<p>Taking a page from game tutorials, I also played with having more immersive and interactive tutorials. Though a common feature like following may not benefit from this, this is where more intensive flows can be explained in great detail. Though there are overlays involved, I wanted to explore how the medium of VR could allow for more interesting ways of presenting tutorials. </p>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Pros:</li></span>
								<p>Allows for detailed explanations of how to interact with a feature, if we have users opt in to these they're likely looking for detailed information</p>
								<br>
								<span class="bodytext-b"><li>Cons:</li></span>
								<p>If lengthy it can be fatiguing for a user, uncertain how much a user may retain from a tutorial, tutorials don't necessarily encourage habits</p>
								<br>
							</ul>
							<br>
					<p class="h3" id="fdvrDecision">Decisions</p>
						<p>We determined that a combination of the onboarding setup and the in-feed prompter was the most viable decision to go forward with for our current needs.</p>
						<br>
						<p>To account for the fact that people may be hesitant to start following people before seeing the feed, we decided to allow for people to skip the onboarding overlay if they wanted to. Once inside the feed, the in-feed prompters would be there to continuously encourage people to follow others. To prevent them from taking up undue space, we would have these prompters only show up on the first page. </p>
						<br>
					<p class="h3" id="fdvrResults">Results</p>						
						<p>Unfortunately, we haven't launched the design for this just yet due to development time being spent on our mobile side.</p>
