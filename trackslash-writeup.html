					<p>Our team's goal was to come up with a feasible product pitch within 10 weeks in our Product Management class. Given that we were all new to product management, being primarily engineers and designers, this was a daunting challenge.</p> 
					<div class="bigtext">"Working on a fitness goal isn't easy or fun."</div>
					<p>Our team envisioned a product that could combine the fun of RPGs with fitness tracking. Gamification could be a motivator for getting into fitness.</p>
					<p>As the chief user experience designer, my focus was creating a first pass at a cohesive app experience that demonstrated the value that our concept could bring to users. </p>

He avidly enjoys playing World of Warcraft, but he noticed that he's been gaining some weight. He has tried to go to the gym a few times in the last year, but got discouraged from the lack of results. His friends are not into fitness and he doesn't own a Fitbit so getting into fitness is pretty difficult.</p>

She's been meaning to exercise more and be healthier so she can have more energy for her job, but it's difficult for her to schedule gym time in with her busy schedule. She does enjoy weekend soccer games with her friends, but she wants to figure out other ways of having fun while getting fit.</p>

He is pretty fit, but lately he has been plateauing in his day-to-day exercise routine.

				<div class="subheader" id="trackslash-competitive">Competitive Analysis</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					Track & Slash's main differentiation is its high level of fitness engagement at a lower price. Our biggest competitor would be Pokemon Go. We therefore focused features of our app that would fill weaknesses of Pokemon Go as a fitness app. Namely, Pokemon Go lacks fitness data and other features that directly promote greater fitness in its users.

			<div class="writeup-section">
				<div class="subheader" id="trackslash-userstories">User Stories</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					User stories helped guide our vision of the app and brainstorm features that keep user needs central.

			<div class="writeup-section">
				<div class="subheader" id="trackslash-wireframes">Key Decisions</div>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p>For our primary sprint, we created a clickable prototype to test on seven people in their early twenties. We decided to focus on developing the character customization flow, as this was the primary feature that brought the fitness and roleplaying aspects together in the app.  Some of our initial decisions are documented below.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How do we integrate fitness and RPG?</p>
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/trackslash-homepagelayout.png">
					<p>As we were targeting people who have difficulties with being fit, we hypothesized that the RPG character would be important as a motivator. We therefore kept the character central to the homepage. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="bodytext-h">How does real-life fitness translate to in-game character ability?</p>
					<p>Fitness points buy items that imbue the character with abilities.  Therefore character items became a natural bridge between fitness points, character abilities, and character stats. This streamlined how users could use their fitness points, keeping the game lightweight and appropriate for a mobile platform. 
					<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/trackslash-fitnessptcharability.png">
					One of the benefits of this system was that even those who may not be as fit as others in real life would be able to battle on 'equal ground.' Given that lack of natural ability is often a deterrant for fitness, we didn't want our app replicating that.</p>
