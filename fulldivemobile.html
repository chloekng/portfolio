			<div class="h1">Fulldive Mobile - <p class="h2"> defining our app beyond mobile VR </p></div>
			<br>
			<div class="bodytext">
				<p>Fulldive started out as a mobile VR platform that aggregates VR videos, games, and apps. Though we were moderately successful in the mobile VR space, Fulldive began looking into making a mobile component of the app. Mobile VR is still a niche market, and one that is limited by the specific environment using a virtual reality headset is acceptable in. By creating a non-VR version of our app, we hoped to reach a wider audience while also allowing current users access the app on the go.</p> 
				<br>
				<p>What started as "making a mobile version of our app" resulted in our company redefining our value proposition, re-envisioning our app as a content aggregation tool. We succeeded in the VR space by providing people one place for all VR content and media. Rethinking content aggregation in the mobile space was a natural next step. In June 2017, almost a year after our first low-fidelity sketches, we launched the MVP of mobile!</p>

				<p class="h2">From high-level product vision...</p>
				<p>Over summer 2016, I worked as Fulldive's second product designer, kicking off initial work on the mobile component to our VR platform. This involved conducting foundational user research, creating our first wireframes, and running our first round of usability testing. During these first few months, our product vision evolved extensively. The result of these first couple months are documented below.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="h2">...to detailed UX flows</p>
				<p>In January 2017, I joined our three person design team full-time. I worked closely with Grant, our Design Manager, and Anna, a fellow product designer, to dig deep into all the details of the app. Some specific components I contributed include the feed view, <a href="fulldivesaves.html">the saving system</a>, refinements for our video player, and incorporating upvotes/downvotes.</p>

				<p class="h3">FULLDIVE BEYOND VR</p>
					<p class="h2">How can Fulldive approach content curation in a unique manner that brings new value to our users?</p>
						<p>As we grew our userbase, users began requesting a mobile (flat) component to Fulldive so they could browse 360 videos even without a headset. The need for a headset drastically limits VR’s uses, as it’s still not conventional to use a headset in open public like it is to use a mobile phone. By creating a non-VR component to Fulldive, we could increase users’ time with the app. </p>
						<br>
						<p>Around this time, Fulldive also began exploring avenues of growth beyond the virtual reality niche. With a non-VR component, we wanted to see what possibilities there were for Fulldive to evolve. How can Fulldive approach content curation in a unique manner that brings new value to our users? </p>
						<br>
						<p>Our co-founders were excited about the technical possibility of automatically crawling people's watch history. By getting people to sync their accounts with Fulldive, we could provide a fairly accurate picture of what was top watched content among a group of people. The design team had doubts though. There was risk of alienating our current userbase, prevailing concerns about privacy, and questions of the value that was actually provided with such a feature. I realized that we needed user research in order to move forward strategically.</p>
						<Br>
				<p class="h3">USER RESEARCH</p>
					<P class="h2">Are people interested in what their friends are watching?</P>
						<p>Unfortunately, as with many startups, we didn't have much of a budget for user research. I got resourceful and reached out to connections to ask them about their online media consumption and sharing practices. Luckily, they fell into our target audience of younger people who rely on their mobile phones for most of their content. I conducted 5 hour-long interviews, and sent out a survey that gathered 42 responses over a week.</p>
						<Br>
						<p>We also conducted interviews with our current users to learn about their reasons for using Fulldive. Our users liked that Fulldive provided them access to all sorts of VR content (from videos, to games, to apps) in one space. The platform-wide social aspect didn't necessarily interest them, but they did express interest in finding more quality content. Though Fulldive provided them a good introduction to VR, they felt that after a few visits it became harder to find new, quality content.</p>
						<br>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fulldivemobile-userresearch.png">
						<p class="minitext">A snippet of the user research script I wrote up.</p>
						<Br>
						<p>Through my initial qualitative user research, I outlined four general personas and several principles surrounding content sharing that helped us ensure we were keeping user needs in mind while designing. While our research was limited by a small sample size, this initial user research helped the design team develop a point of view and champion the user in discussions about Fulldive’s future vision.</p>
						<Br>
<!-- 					<p class="h2">How are people currently consuming and sharing media? What are some design opportunities?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Media consumption and identity are linked for many people</li>
							<br>
							<li>People differ on whether they make friends based on media, or share media based on friends</li>
							<br>
							<li>However, people share a desire to find others who share their media interests whether this be actively (eg participating in an online community) or passively (eg observing comment sections)</li>
							<br>
							<li>A majority of people rely on social networks (like Facebook, Instagram, or Reddit) to provide them new media</li>
							<br>
							<li>69% of people prefer sharing media via private message, in comparison to 21.4% of people who do so via public posting</li>
							<br>
							<li>A common motivator for sharing media is friendship/a shared interest</li>

					<p class="minitext">Personas!</p>
					<br>
					<p class="h2">Refining Fulldive's Vision</p>
						<p>We found that if we were to stick with our current vision of Fulldive as a platform where you can see what content your friends are watching, the personas Amy and Diego were going to be our target audience. </p>
						<br>
						<p>However, the design team felt that the initial concept for Fulldive Mobile still needed refining. Even for people like Amy and Diego, who are open about what they are watching and sharing with their friends, the act of sharing is significant to them. While it takes work for them to decide to share something, the effort involved in personally showing their friend a link was a way of bonding. Though autocrawling watch history could make finding mutual interests easier, we weren't sure if there was a compelling enough use case to get people to adopt the app. In addition, many people (like personas Cole and Mary), are private regarding their media interests and watch history, such that autocrawling presents a big barrier to adoption. </p>
						<br>
						<p>Nevertheless, we moved forward with this initial vision. Though we had our doubts, we figured we would learn the most by getting a product out in front of people and getting feedback.</p>
						<Br>
					<p class="h3">FIRST ITERATION</p>
						<p class="h2">Sketches, sketches, sketches</p>
						<p>Grant and I dug deep into sketching and ideation for Fulldive Mobile. Sketches helped us quickly consider various possible layouts. To get a holistic view of the app, I mapped the overall information architecture of the app on our wall. This was useful in helping our team discuss together and get on the same page.</p>
						<br>
						<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fulldivemobile-sketches.png">

						<br>
						<p class="h2">Mid-fidelity</p>
						<p>From sketches we quickly moved into mid-fidelity and built out a clickable prototype on Marvel to show users. It was exciting laying the initial structure of the app down and showing it to people.</p>

					<p class="h2">Usability Tests</p>
					<p>I facilitated 5 usability tests with people in our target demographic. We were pleasantly surprised to see that people seemed to understand the overall infrastructure of our app pretty well. However, there were some questions regarding the product vision. When we asked participants what problem they saw this app solving for them, all were skeptical towards the sharing view history aspect. By contrast, the content aggregation aspect stood out for everyone. Aggregating and customizing their feed was more compelling than seeing what their friends were watching.</p>

				<p>Combined with the doubts that we had from our initial user research, we knew that we needed to clarify our app's vision and really make sure we were solving a problem worth solving. </p>

				<p class="minitext">How our app changed after we clarified our product direction.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="h3">A NEW DIRECTION FOR FULLDIVE MOBILE</p>
				<p class="h2">People need an app that can help them keep up to date on all the content they are interested in, across all different platforms, whether from their friends or their personal interests.</p>
				<p>At this point, we knew our app was missing something. After much conversation across the company, we decided to revisit Fulldive Mobile's problem statement and refine it. Our user research, data on our current users, usability test results, and general feedback made us realize how our app could serve a more prevalent need &mdash; <span class="bodytext-b"> aggregating and decluttering online content</span>. We pared the overly general value proposition of our app to specific problem statements that we were solving for:</p>
				<Br>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="bodytext-o">Many people have multiple sites that they check to keep updated on their personal interests. Actually keeping up to date on everything across multiple platforms is time consuming.</span> We allow people to aggregate content from their favorite sources into one feed. They can check one app to get news from multiple outlets, their daily dose of cute pugs, and those 17 travel blogs they always forget to check. And all nicely organized how they like it.</li>
						<br>
						<li><span class="bodytext-o">Because of the ease of checking only one feed, people find themselves just mindlessly scrolling through content on Facebook despite finding much of that content not relevant. Much of this is down to the fact that people don't necessarily share interests with their friends. </span> We let people choose what they want to see based on their personal interests, not their friends. They can choose to group all their favorite blogs about dogs into a feed called "Puppers," or throw in memes alongside their daily news update. And if they're sick of seeing politics everywhere, they won't see it. It's up to them.</li>
						<Br>
						<li><span class="bodytext-o">People have particular tastes regarding content that they don't trust to an algorithm. They like to have control over what content they see.</span> People input the content sources they're already interested in. We don't assume they're into Taylor Swift just because they listen to Carly Rae Jepsen. Their feed is 100% content that they have chosen to incorporate. </li>

					<p>As a company, we felt excited about this new vision for Fulldive Mobile! We showed a new prototype to users and got positive feedback in return. Of course, our app can continuously improve, but hearing people's opinions let us know we were headed in the right direction.</p>

					<br>
					<div class="writeup-subsection">
						<p class="h2">I can see using this over reddit because while reddit has people submitting links from different sources, no one has to do any submitting and it aggregates it for you. I can just get all my sports sites in one deck and don't have to visit multiple sites, which seems pretty useful.</p>

				<p class="h3">LAUNCH</p>
				<p class="h2">Making the MVP of Fulldive Mobile</p>
					<p>Though we were all excited about Fulldive Mobile's future vision, we now faced the challenge of getting buyin from our current users. Given that our users go to Fulldive VR in order to find quality VR content and media in one place, it only made sense for Fulldive Mobile to take this a step further. However, we also knew that people primarily associated our app with virtual reality. Opening our app to other content may be confusing for them, or make them feel like their content was being diluted. We decided to launch our updates incrementally to ease people into it.</p>
					<Br>
				<p class="h2">Increase retention rate, check</p>
					<p>We launched a MVP of Fulldive Mobile in June! This first version maps much closer to the current Fulldive VR experience, providing users a feed of top VR content that they can interact with. Though this MVP doesn't include many of the future features we're looking to develop, we were pleased to see our retention rate go up. </p>

				<p class="h2">Advocating for people</p>
					<p>Making mobile was a huge project &mdash; not necessarily due to number of screens, but due to a disconnect between what we were designing and what our users were saying. I learned firsthand that design is as much about advocating for people through solid user research as it is about getting into the nitty gritty UX of a flow. You can't design a good UX if you don't know who you're designing for!</p>
				<br>
				<p class="h2">Design systems</p>
					<p>As we designed our second major iteration, we began incorporating a design system. We wish we had started this earlier! It speeds up the workflow, makes everything look more cohesive, and helps with development.</p>
