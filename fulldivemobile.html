					<p class="h2">From mobile VR to content aggregation</p>
					<p>Fulldive began primarily as a mobile VR platform. As we grew our userbase, users began requesting a mobile (flat) component to Fulldive so they could browse 360 videos even without a headset.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Around this time, Fulldive also began exploring avenues of growth beyond the virtual reality niche. <span class="highlight">With a non-VR component, we wanted to see what possibilities there were for Fulldive to evolve and draw in new users.</span></p>

						<p>I also conducted interviews with our current users to learn about their reasons for using Fulldive. Some findings:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>People liked that Fulldive provided them access to all sorts of VR content in one space</li>
								<li>The platform-wide social aspect didn't necessarily interest them, but they did express interest in finding more quality content</li>
								<li>Though Fulldive provided them a good introduction to VR, they felt that after a few visits it became harder to find new, quality content</li>

				<p>I facilitated <span class="highlight">5 usability tests</span> with people in our target demographic. We were pleasantly surprised to see that people seemed to understand the overall infrastructure of our app pretty well. However, there were some questions regarding product vision:</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>When we asked participants what problem they saw this app solving for them, they were skeptical towards the usefulness of sharing view history</li>
						<br>
						<li>By contrast, content aggregation stood out</li>
						<br>
						<li>Aggregating and customizing their feed was more compelling than seeing what their friends were watching</li>

				<p class="h2">Fulldive as a place where you can streamline your content consumption</p>
				<p>For our second iteration, we prioritized Fulldive as a content aggregator based on people's feedback. With this iteration, we completely redesigned the homepage and introduced <span class="highlight">decks, custom feeds people can make of their favorite content sources.</span></p>
				<br>
				<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fulldivemobile-secondit.png">
				<p class="minitext">Iteration 2 - select screens; I took ownership over the content cards, standardizing the article and video views, and the save/tag function.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We once again conducted usability tests. In general, we found that people grasped the product vision quicker than before and had more positive feelings towards the app.</p>		
				<Br>
				<div class="writeup-subsection">
					<p class="h3-2">It's pretty convenient, I have a feeling that my life will get easier. I'm pretty sure I would actually use it as it has filters to generate actual sources.</p>

				<p>At this point, our developers completed a first iteration of the app and we were able to have limited live testing. During this testing period, we found a new set of issues we needed to improve on:</p>	
					<ul>
						<li>Some areas of the app feel disjointed from each other, like they're part of separate apps</li>
						<br>
						<li>Many people actually don't want that many sources per deck and would rather group their decks</li>
						<br>
						<li>Too many decks on the homepage makes scrolling difficult, we need a navigation system for decks</li>
						<Br>
						<li>Content discovery is hard to find</li>

				<p class="h2">Fulldive as a place to discover new content in their interests</p>
				<p>For Iteration 3, we focused on improving Fulldive's capabilities for finding new content through making the search and tag system more central. We also put renewed focus on making sure the overall structure of our app made sense. On a three day design sprint, we rapidly iterated on different ways of structuring the main components of our app. <span class="highlight">In between 4 rounds of iterations, we A/B tested guerilla style on 18 people.</span></p>
				<br>
				<img class="writeup-img" src="assets/img/fulldivemobile-thirdit.png">
				<p class="minitext">Iteration 3 - various iterations from our rapid iterative testing</p>
				<br>
				<p>Through this rapid iterative testing, we were able to try out many solutions from structural to language changes in a short time frame. Based on our findings, we decided to make the following high-level changes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Implement bottom nav, as it lays out the main functions of the app clearly</li>
						<br>
						<li>Let people organize decks into "collections" accessible in the side menu</li>
						<br>
						<li>Let people follow tags and add them to the side menu </li>
						<br>
						<li>Implement a design system to unify the entire app</li>
					</ul>
				<br>
				<p>We're still working on implementing these changes, including flushing out more detailed flows!</p>

				<p>One of the biggest challenges of this project was our constantly evolving product vision. However, as we saw how users responded to each new iteration, we were able to become more confident in our direction. I also came to value the strength of a unified design team that works hard to advocate for the user. I'm looking forward to how Fulldive continues to evolve.</p>
